# Benchmarks for GeoWave

This project is a collection of benchmarks (currently for point clouds only) used internally to test and evaluate the performance of various configurations of [GeoWave](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave).  

# Origin

GeoWave and related projects were developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [RadiantBlue Technologies](http://www.radiantblue.com/) and [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/).  The government has ["unlimited rights"](https://github.com/ngageoint/geowave/blob/master/NOTICE) and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) license.
